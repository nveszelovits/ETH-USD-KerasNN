# ETH-USD-KerasNN
Neural network built using keras that predicts the price of Etherium

The goal of this project was the create a nerual network that predicts if Etherium will rise on a certain day based on its
performace the previous week. Based on the seed it reaches an accuracy of about .55. Im currently trying to improve the
model by making it reach higher maximums during training using methods I learned in a recent class. Future plans also
#include automating trading using WebSocket data.

I created this with information learned in class and personal research. I learned how to use keras mainly from the DeepLizard
machine learning playlist on their website.
